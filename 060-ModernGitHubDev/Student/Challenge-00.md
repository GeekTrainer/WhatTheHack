**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-01.md)

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in the ModernGitHubDev What The Hack. Before you can hack, you will need to set up some prerequisites.

## Common Prerequisites

We have compiled a list of common tools and software that will come in handy to complete most What The Hack Azure-based hacks!

You might not need all of them for the hack you are participating in. However, if you work with Azure on a regular basis, these are all things you should consider having in your toolbox.

## Description

The shelter has an application already created by a vendor they wish to use as the foundation for their website. The project currently resides on GitHub as a template. The first step is for you to obtain the source code and create a repository on GitHub to maintain a separate copy. The changes you make will **not** be merged back to the original application.

The project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)/[React](https://reactjs.org/) project using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). It is based on the [Next.js MongoDB example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mongodb).

> **IMPORTANT**: This hackathon does **not** require experience with JavaScript, React or Next.js.

## Success Criteria

- You have a copy of the existing application in a repository in your account/organization
- You have **not** created a fork of the existing repository
